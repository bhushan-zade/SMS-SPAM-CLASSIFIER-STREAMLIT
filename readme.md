# **`Email/SMS Spam Classifier`**

Spamming is the use of messaging systems to send multiple unsolicited messages (spam) to large numbers of recipients for the purpose of commercial advertising, for the purpose of non-commercial proselytizing, for any prohibited purpose (especially the fraudulent purpose of phishing), or simply repeatedly sending the same message to the same user. While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social spam, spam mobile apps, television advertising and file sharing spam.

Spam emails are something weâ€™ve all experienced. Spam mail, often known as junk mail, is an email that is sent to a large number of people at once, sometimes with cryptic messages, scams, or, most dangerously, phishing information. The problem here is that the email needs to be classified as spam or ham based on the content of the mail.
